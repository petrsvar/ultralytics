            My first mobile App. It was developed upon prototype made for Vodafone R&D Group for Venice Biennial in 2007.     
            <br /><br />
            A game that turns your phone into a remote control to command people.     
            <br /><br />
            What happens when we take this simulated reality out of the box and introduce it to the real world? Suddenly, binary code gains the power to toy with people’s emotions, and an unpredictable social game will ensue…
            <br /><br />
            Flirtman is a game where one player [FRED] sends commands to the other player [JERRY] who must carry them out, while other people don’t know that he is under control. It is a kind of remote control, where commands are in sound form, delivered via the Internet, and played to Jerry’s ears through a headset.
